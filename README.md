# library
In this project, I will be creating a small library app. This library app will allow users to add and remove a book and see it displayed, as well as mark if the book has been read ot not.

This project will demonstrate my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills thus far. As I have recently learned more about Javascript objects and prototypes, this project will be good practice applying what I have learned.

I am looking forward to creating this library app and build it step by step.
